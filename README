1. Introduction
---------------

OFELI is an object oriented library of C++ classes for development of finite element codes.
Its main features are:
* Various storage schemes of matrices (dense, sparse, skyline).
* Direct methods of solution of linear systems of equations as well as
  various combinations of iterative solvers and preconditioners.
* Shape functions of most "popular" finite elements
* Element arrays of most popular problems (Heat Transfer, Fluid Flow, Solid
  Mechanics, Electromagnetics, ...).

The OFELI package is not only a library of classes for Finite Element developments. The package
contains in addition :

* Very simple examples for "academic" finite element codes
* More elaborated codes for various types of problems
* Utility programs to convert mesh and output files and to generate simple meshes

2. Installation
---------------

The OFELI package can be installed on Linux, Unix and Windows (95/98/NT/2000/XP) systems.

Unix Installation:

The following instructions apply to UNIX (like) systems only.
The only thing you need is a C++ compiler.

A clean installation can be performed in the following steps:
* 'gunzip' and 'untar' the downloaded file.
* Edit the file OFELI_Config.h in directory 'include' and modify the line defining 'PATH_MATERIAL'
  according to your directory installation. This procedure will be automatized in the forthcoming
  releases.
* Execute the configuration script by typing:
     ./configure
  A first execution with argument --help displays a short manual of the script.
  A typical execution looks like:
     ./configure --enable-release --prefix=/home/me/ofeli --libdir=/home/me/lib --bindir=/home/me/bin CXXFLAGS=-O4


Windows Installation :

To install on Windows system, you must have the Visual C++ compiler.
The installation procedure depends on the file you have downloaded.

* If this is a zip file then you must unzip it, go the subdirectory windows where you can find
  Visual C++ workspace to install the library, utilities, examples, and demos.
  You can also install the package by using the makefile by executing
     nmake -f makefile.vc
  Here also the Visual C++ compiler is required.

* If this is an exe file, than this is a standard windows setup installator. The library and
  the examples and demo files are already compiled. You can also recompile using Visual C++
  workspace.

* Edit the file OFELI_Config.h in directory 'include' and modify the line defining 'PATH_MATERIAL'
  according to your directory installation. This procedure will be automatized in the forthcoming
  releases.
