# rita Script file to solve the same equation as the previous example
#
# The difference here is that we first declare the function defining the
# equation 
#
function name=f var=y def=y^2-2
algebraic function=f init=1. nls=newton
solve
y
#
# We transfer solution (which is a vector) to a parameter
a = y[0]
#
# We list all data
