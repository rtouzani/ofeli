# rita Script file to solve a nonlinear system of algebraic equations
# We numerically solve the system
#    x1*x1-2*x1*x2 = 2,    x1 + x2^2 = -1
# This system has 2 solutions:
#    x1 = -1.11509, x2 =  0.339246 and
#    x1 = -3.93432, x2 = -1.71298
# The code gives solution when an appropriate initial guess is given
# Note that we define the algebraic system by using the extended version
# of the keyword 'algebraic'
