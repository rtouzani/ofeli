# This example treats matrices and vectors

# We read matrix contents from a file: The matrix A has tridiagonal storage
matrix file=m1.dat
A

# We read another matrix, stored in skyline format
matrix file=m2.dat
B

# We read the same matrix but stored in sparse format
matrix file=m3.dat
C

# Compute a linear combination of matrices B and C
D = B + 2*C
