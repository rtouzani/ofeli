This folder contains a list of demo programs to solve 1D partial differential equations using OFELI.

1. demo1D1
   A demo program to solve a 2-point boundary equation and compute discretization error.
   To execute the program, type

          demo2D1 <n>

   where n is the number of finite elements. Its default value is 10.

2. demo1D2
   A demo program to solve a 2D parabolic equation.
   To execute the program, type

          demo2D2 <n> [dt]

   where file is the project file containing all necessary data (here 'demo2.dat') including mesh file and time discretization data.
