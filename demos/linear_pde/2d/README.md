This folder contains a list of demo programs to solve 2D partial differential equations using OFELI.

1. demo2D1
   A demo program to solve a 2D elliptic equation and compute discretization error.
   To execute the program, type

          demo2D1 <file>

   where file is the project file containing all necessary data (here 'demo1.dat'). Among them is the mesh file which is 
   'mesh1.m'.

2. demo2D2
   A demo program to solve a 2D parabolic equation.
   To execute the program, type

          demo2D2 <file>

   where file is the project file containing all necessary data (here 'demo2.dat') including mesh file and time discretization data.

3. demo2D3
   A demo program to solve a 2D hyperbolic equation, the wave equation.
   To execute the program, type

          demo2D3 <file>

   where file is the project file containing all necessary data (here 'demo3.dat') including mesh file and time discretization data.
