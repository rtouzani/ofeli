Program contact
---------------
A finite element code using OFELI to solve a 2-d linear elastostatic problem
with contact with a rigid obstacle.

Two examples are provided for testing:
1. One elastic beam over a rigid obstacle
2. The traditional Hertz test.

All provided data files are in XML format.
The file beam.dat concerns the beam test with all data included in one single XML file.
