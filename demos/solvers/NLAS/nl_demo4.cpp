                    A program to illustrate the NLAS solver

                 Solution of a system of 2 nonlinear equations
                       by the Newton's method

         x1*x1-2*x1*x2 = 2
         x1 + x2^2 = -1

     The approximate solutions the system are x1 = -1.11509, x2 =  0.339246 
                                          and x1 = -3.93432, x2 = -1.71298

     The function and its gradient are given by user defined functions
