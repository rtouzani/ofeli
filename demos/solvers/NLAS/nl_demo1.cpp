                    A program to illustrate the NLAS solver

                      Solution of the equation    f(x) = 0
    where x is a real variable.
    The problem is solved by the Regula Falsi method.

    In the example f(x) = x^2-2.
    The function f is given as a user defined function

#include "OFELI.h"
using namespace OFELI;

double f(double x)
{
   return x*x-2;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   double x = 0.;
   NLASSolver nls(x,REGULA_FALSI);
   nls.setFunction(function<double(double)>(f));
   Verbosity = 3;
   nls.setInitial(0.,2.);
   nls.run();
   cout << "Solution: " << x << endl;
   cout << nls;
   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
