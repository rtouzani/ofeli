                    A program to illustrate the NLAS solver

                      Solution of the equation    f(x) = 0
    where x is a real variable.
    The problem is solved by the secant method (Newton's method with constant
    derivative).

    In the example f(x) = x^2-2.
    The function f is given by a regular expression
