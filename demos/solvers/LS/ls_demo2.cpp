                A program to illustrate the LinearSolver class
                           for solving linear systems
 
   The tested linear system issues from a finite element discretization of the
   Poisson problem.
   Since the resulting matrix is symmetric positive definite, we use the
   Conjugate Gradient method preconditioned by the Diagonal preconditioner
