          A simple code to test the differential equation solver

    This code tests the ODE solver with the sample differential system:

                      A1*y' + A0*y = f

    where
              /          \         /         \       /                 \
              |  0   -1  |         | 1    0  |       |        0        |
         A0 = |          |,   A1 = |         |,  b = |                 |
              |  1   -1  |         | 0    1  |       | 3*(t-1)*exp(-t) |
              \          /         \         /       \                 /

   The solution is given by:
      y1 = t*exp(-t), y2 = (1-t)*exp(-t)
      
   Argument for execution: Time step
   You can test the code with various schemes by modifying the line:
        ODESolver ode(RK4,theTimeStep,theFinalTime,2);
   Just replace RK4 by FORWARD_EULER, BACKWARD_EULER, CRANK_NICOLSON,
   HEUN, AB2, BDF2
