          Solution of the Lorenz dynamical system by the RK4 scheme
                       using the ODESolver class

       We consider the ODE system:

           y1' = 10*(y2-y1)
           y2' = y1*(27-y3) - y2
           y3' = y1*y2 - 8/3*y3

       with the initial condition y1 = 1, y2 = 0, y3 = 0
