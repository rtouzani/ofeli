    Solution of the pendulum differential equation using the ODESolver class

       We consider the ODE equation:
                     y'' + 0.2*y' + sin(y) = 2*sin(t)
       with the initial conditions: y(0) = 10, y(2) = 1

       We solve the problem by writing it as a system of 2 first-order ODE
       equations
