  A simple production planning problem is given by the use of two ingredients A 
  and B that produce products 1 and 2. The available supply of A is 30 units 
  and B is 44 units. For production it requires:

    3 units of A and 8 units of B to produce Product 1
    6 units of A and 4 units of B to produce Product 2 

  There are at most 5 units of Product 1 and 4 units of Product 2. Product 1 can 
  be sold for 100 and Product 2 can be sold for 125. The objective is to maximize 
  the profit for this production problem. 

  The linear program can be stated as follows:
 
       Maximize x1 + x2 + 3*x3 -0.5*x4 
       Subject to the constraints:
          x1  + 2x3 <= 740
          2x2 - 7x4 <= 0
          x2  - x3 + 2x4 >= 0.5
          x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 9
          and all x's >=0.
