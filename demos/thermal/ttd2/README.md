Program ttd2
------------
A finite element code using OFELI to solve the heat equation in 2-D

The program is tested with an exact solution.
Mesh files ptoj-5x10.m, proj-5x20.m, proj-5x40.m and proj-5x80.m
produce various discretization errors.

Modify file proj.dat to run the program with these mesh files.
See documentation for a description of the test.
